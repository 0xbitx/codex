## Little FAQ
**What the fuck is static virus??**  
Static virus is the virus/trojan that has already had all its functions been defined and would not be controlled by server side. Instead, it would only send critical information (Chrome password, etc.) slowly and predictedly to server side by tricky ways (Sendgrid, AWS, Qcloud, etc.).  

 
**Why use it??**  
Because the virus generated could always bypass the anti-virus softwares. If not, then make some modification on the modules you are using.  

**Am I authorized to hack others' computer??**  
No, but why not.
